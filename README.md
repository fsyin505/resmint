A Responsive Smint

To run the demo, unzip the package, and launch index.html in a browser

This demo is based off of Smint by Robert McCracken 
http://www.outyear.co.uk/smint/

Notes:
- base styles default for mobile devices (progressive enhancement)
- click-to-drop-down menu added for small screens
- most of the original Smint functionality is maintained
- JS function is mostly redone to accomodate mobile menu logic
- some of the code comments were deleted to help myself organize
- will not work in old IE (<9) but neither does the original, and most sane websites for that matter
